- This repository is for a tower defense game made using godot.

- Solely developed on a respberry pi 5 that I turned into a "laptop".

- I will document the parts used to turn the raspberry pi into a "laptop", 
 icluding the price and also some comments.

- !!!WARNING!!! THIS IS NOT ADVICE ON HOW TO DEVELOP A GAME IN GODOT,
 IT IS ALSO NOT ADVICE ON HOW TO TURN A RASPBERRY PI INTO A "LAPTOP",
 THIS IS MERELY HOW I MANAGED IT, 
 IF YOU ARE TURNING YOUR RASPBERRY PI INTO A "LAPTOP" MAKE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.
